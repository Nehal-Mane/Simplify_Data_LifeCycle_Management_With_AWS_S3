# Multiple Small Use Cases for AWS S3 Data Lifecycle Management

**1. Archiving Old Logs:**
- Scenario: You have an application that generates large volumes of log files.
- DLM Configuration: Transition old log files to Glacier storage after a specified period, and delete them after a longer retention period.

**2. Managing Temporary Files:**
- Scenario: You have a web application that generates temporary files.
- DLM Configuration: Automatically delete temporary files after a certain period.

**3. Migrating Data to Glacier:**
- Scenario: You want to migrate infrequently accessed data to Glacier for long-term storage.
- DLM Configuration: Create a lifecycle rule to transition data to Glacier after a specified period.

**4. Implementing Data Retention Policies:**
- Scenario: You need to comply with data retention regulations.
- DLM Configuration: Define lifecycle rules to retain data for the required duration and then delete it.

**5. Optimizing Storage Costs:**
- Scenario: You want to reduce storage costs for infrequently accessed data.
- DLM Configuration: Transition data to lower-cost storage classes (e.g., Glacier) based on access patterns.

**6. Managing Backup Data:**
- Scenario: You use S3 for backups.
- DLM Configuration: Set up lifecycle rules to retain backups for a specific period and then delete them.

**7. Automating Data Purging:**
- Scenario: You need to regularly purge data from your S3 buckets.
- DLM Configuration: Create expiration rules to automatically delete data after a specified period.

**8. Managing Temporary Files for a Web Application:**
- Scenario: Your web application generates temporary files (e.g., uploaded images).
- DLM Configuration: Set up lifecycle rules to delete temporary files after a specified period.
